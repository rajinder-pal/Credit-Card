Credit Card Fraud Prediction
This project focuses on building a classification model to predict fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques.

Project Overview

Problem Statement: Identify fraudulent transactions in a dataset of credit card purchases made by European cardholders in September 2013.
Data: The highly imbalanced dataset (0.172% fraud cases) contains 284,807 transactions with labeled fraudulent and legitimate transactions.
Objectives:
Analyze, clean, and pre-process the data.
Handle data imbalance using appropriate methods.
Engineer new features or transform existing ones for improved model performance.
Select, train, and validate a machine learning model for fraud prediction.
Evaluate the model's accuracy and generalization capability.
Tasks/Activities List

Data Collection

Download the credit card transaction data from the provided CSV file (creditcard.csv).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Perform data quality checks to identify missing values, outliers, and data types.
Analyze descriptive statistics and create visualizations to understand patterns and relationships within the data.
Clean and pre-process the data by handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring consistent data types.
Data Balancing

Address the data imbalance due to a significantly lower number of fraudulent transactions. Apply appropriate techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or SMOTE to balance the dataset.
Feature Engineering and Selection

Create new features based on domain knowledge or feature engineering techniques.
Analyze feature importance and select the most relevant features for model training.
Model Selection, Training, and Evaluation

Choose a suitable classification algorithm (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines) based on the data characteristics.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train the model on the training data.
Validate the model's performance on the unseen testing data using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
Hyperparameter Tuning

Implement hyperparameter tuning techniques (e.g., GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV) to optimize the model's performance.
Model Deployment Plan (Optional)

Outline a strategy for deploying the trained model into a production environment for real-world fraud detection.
Expected Deliverables

A report (PDF) detailing:
Design choices, performance evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning strategies.
Discussion of potential improvements and future work.
The source code used to create the fraud detection pipeline.
Success Metrics

Model accuracy on the testing data exceeding 75% (subjective measure).
Implementation of hyperparameter tuning methods.
Rigorous model validation.
Bonus Points

Package the solution in a zip file with a README that explains installation and execution.
Demonstrate documentation skills by describing how the project benefits the company (e.g., improved fraud detection accuracy reduces financial losses).
